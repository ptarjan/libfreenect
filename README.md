Horribly hacky first take at a Kinect Camera driver. Does RGB and Depth.

main.c implements a simple OpenGL visualization. Hopefully it should be mostly
self-explanatory... You pretty much just open the USB device, call
`cams_init(dev, depthimg, rgbimg)`, and your `depthimg` and `rgbimg` callbacks get
called as libusb processes events.

TODO:
* TONS of cleanup. I mean LOTS.
* Determine exactly what the inits do
* Bayer to RGB conversion that doesn't suck
* Integrate support for the servo and accelerometer (which have already been reverse engineered)

BIG TODO: audio. The audio chip (the Marvell) requires firmware and more init
and does a TON of stuff including the crypto authentication to prove that it is
an original Kinect and not a clone. Who knows what this thing does to the
incoming audio. This should be interesting to look at.
